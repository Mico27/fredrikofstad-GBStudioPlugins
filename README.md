## Swap Tiles

https://nokotin.itch.io/tile-swap-plugin-for-gb-studio

This plugin is mostly a quality of life script as it replaces the time consuming task of adding GBVM commands line by line and having to worry about pushing and popping values to the stack.

Instead just plop a few values into the event script and you'll be animating tiles in no time!

You can choose to change between 1-50 tiles, either 8x8 or 16x16 and how many frames you wish to be animated.
For infinite loop animations this event should be put into an actor's update loop (alternatively a timer). The wait time between frames is entered directly into the event script.

Besides animating your rivers and waterfalls, you can use this plugin for HUDs, menus, and other graphical changes to your scene.


## UI Plugin Pack

Not currently released but available on github

## Cutsom Projectile

This plugin allows the user to further customize projectiles. You can choose between several presets including: Sine wave, Orbiting, Boomerang, Arc, and further customize the parameters in built-in events.
