# Plugin Collection for GB Studio

This is a collection (currently one) of plugins I've written for GB Studio.


## Swap Tiles

This plugin is mostly a quality of life script as it replaces the time consuming task of adding GBVM commands line by line and having to worry about pushing and popping values to the stack. 

Instead just plop a few values into the event script and you'll be animating tiles in no time!

You can choose to change between 1-8 tiles, either 8x8 or 16x16 and how many frames you wish to be animated.
